    <h1>Database System Management</h1>
    <p>With the advancements in the technology of graphics processing units (GPUs), many computations can be performed faster on the GPUs than the CPUs. They are also programmable, making them useful for not just computer graphics processing but also general-purpose computations. Therefore, they are a natural choice as high-speed coprocessors to the CPUs in various applications. </p>
